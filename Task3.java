    /**
     * TODO:
     * Write a program which asks the user how many bottles of water they wish to order (an integer).
     * The price per bottle without VAT is 0:78 pounds (i.e., 78 pence) and VAT is 20%.
     * The program should calculate the total price with and without VAT and produce the following
     * output:
     * Total Cost Without VAT: xx.xx pounds
     * Total Cost With VAT: yy.yy pounds
     * where xx.xx is the total cost without VAT in pounds (printed to 2 decimal places) and yy.yy
     * is the total cost with VAT in pounds printed to 2 decimal places.
     * Hint: You should use constants in the code, e.g., for VAT and the price per bottle.
     * Note: Do not try to print the pound symbol - this can cause problems and can be fairly tricky
