     * TODO: This is an extension task, so do it if you wish
     * Extend your solution to Task 3 (copy it first) so that a receipt is produced which looks like:
     * Dwr Cymru Water - Receipt
     * Bottles of Water: n
     * Cost Without VAT: xx.xx pounds
     * Total Cost With VAT: yy.yy pounds
     * @see Use <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/format-specifiers-in-java">format specifiers</a>
     * to align the text and print the money values to 2 decimal places.
     * Use a constant for the company name.
     * Updating the company name should automatically yield
     * a centred title on the receipt. To accomplish this you can use format specifiers and a little
     * maths. You should also store the receipt width (number of characters) in a constant.
